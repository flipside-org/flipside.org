Tonight we'll be at [Florida After Seven](http://floridaafterseven.com) again, Lisbon's monthly meetup for people interested in everything related to the web. It's a great place to meet like-minded people in the city and keep up to date with the latest projects and tech. This edition, I'll be hosting a talk on Jekyll, the static site generator we've been using in some of our projects, including this website.

Static site generators are all about going back to basics by cutting on the overhead and complexity that a CMS adds. Jekyll is one of the more popular generators thanks to a great eco-system of [plugins](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/), good documentation and the fact that GitHub Pages run Jekyll out of the box.

If you're interested in seeing some of this in action, join us tonight between 18:00 and 19:00 at [Hotel Florida](https://www.facebook.com/events/161494977352214/).

UPDATE: You can find the presentation on [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/danielfdsilva/intro-to-jekyll) and the demo site on [github](https://github.com/danielfdsilva/FA7_21_jekyll)
