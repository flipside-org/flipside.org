On Thursday August 29, we'll be hosting the first Lisbon Open Data Maker Night. It will be an informal gathering focused on making stuff with Open Data. 

###For who
Everybody is welcome, you don't need to be a skilled developer, data scientist or designer to make things happen. We'll prepare a list of potential things people can work on, trying to cover different skill-sets and interests. If these are your first steps in making things with data we'll pair you up with somebody that can get you started.  
During the evening, everybody will have the opportunity to suggest tasks and themes to work on instead.

###RSVP
The event will be held at [Liberdade 229](http://www.liberdade229.com), conveniently located in the center of Lisbon.

__Date__: August 29, 2013  
__Time__: 18:30 - 22:30  
__Location__: Avenida de Liberdade 229, Lisboa
