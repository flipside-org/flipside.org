We're excited to announce that Ricardo Mestre has joined Flipside. Ricardo is a talented designer and front-end developer that has been pushing the envelope on using modern technologies to craft usable and engaging websites. Whether it's as a [designer and coder](http://duplos.org), as a [musician](http://soundcloud.com/ricardomestre), or as an illustrator of [book covers](http://indexebooks.com/o-corredor-de-fundo.html), his work shows great thought and purpose. 

At Flipside, Ricardo will be leading design in all its aspects and raise the bar when it comes to the visual impact and usability of the things we build. We couldn't be more thrilled to welcome him on the team and look forward to show the mark he'll leave on our work.
