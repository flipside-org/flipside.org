Last week we launched a thoroughly redesigned version of flipside.org. The previous iteration had remained almost unchanged ever since Flipside started and we felt the need to update the site to make it a good reflection of our team and work.

{% include content_img.html path="notes/note-flipside-redesign-process.png" %}
Happy as we were with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), we decided to stick with the underlying architecture. This has allowed us to focus on design and content and put our effort into ensuring a pleasant and consistent experience across all modern devices. Like the previous website, we wanted the new structure and appearance to be clean, elegant and intuitive.

Over the next couple of weeks, we will be sharing some more insights on how we implemented certain things. Keep an eye on our notes section or subscribe to the [RSS feed](http://flipside.org/feed.xml) if you want to know more.

In the meantime, it would be great to hear your opinion about the redesign, so feel free to reach out.
