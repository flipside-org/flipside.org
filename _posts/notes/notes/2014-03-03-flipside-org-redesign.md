As some of you might have noticed, this website has been the subject of a thorough redesign, after the previous iteration had remained mostly unchanged since we started the company in 2011. Over the past years Flipside has seen a lot of changes: we worked on great projects with our partners and our team has slowly, but organically, grown. To accompany these changes, we felt a need to redesign our website and have a better place to share our work and notes with everybody.

## Simple tech
Happy as we were with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for our previous website, we decided not to switch the underlying architecture. This has allowed us to focus on design and content and put our effort into ensuring a pleasant and consistent experience across all devices.  
Another advantage of keeping the tech stack simple, is that the whole team was able to contribute very directly to almost any aspect of the final result. Blurring the lines between the more traditional roles of developers / designers and backend / frontend has been a great experience and a win for the team. The development process was a true team effort and we're very proud of the end result.

Over the next couple of weeks, we will be sharing some more insights on how we implemented certain things. Keep an eye on our notes section or subscribe to our [RSS feed](http://flipside.org/feed.xml) if you want to know more.

In the meantime, it would be great to hear your opinion about the redesign, so feel free to reach out.
