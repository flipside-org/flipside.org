If you're in Lisbon on March 27 and interested in making stuff with Open Data, be sure not to miss out on the next Open Data Maker Night. Everybody is welcome to join us, you don't need to be a skilled data scientist to participate in the event.

In this edition we will reserve space for two brief talks about an Open Data related topic. If you think you have something interesting to share with the other participants, please get in touch so we can put you on the agenda. The goal of the evening, however, remains unchanged: make stuff with Open Data.

### What we'll be working on
Everybody is free to suggest a topic to work on, but there are already a couple of ideas under development:

- **Farm subsidies**  
During past editions we already worked on opening up [spending data](/notes/non-bid-contracts-openspending). This time, some of us will process data on Farm Subsidies and add them to Open Spending.
- **Visualizing diversity**  
Over the past years, a lot of attention was given to the exodus of Portuguese, but little to people coming in. During the night we'll take a look at the diversity of nationalities in Lisbon.

If you want to add anything to this list, please [drop us](mailto:olaf@flipside.org) a line.
