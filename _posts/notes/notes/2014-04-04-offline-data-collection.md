Data collection has taken a big flight these past years with the proliferation of cheap mobile devices. Tools like Open Data Kit, allow organizations to switch from paper based surveys to digital versions, thus greatly improving the process (eg. no data entry) and the possibilties (GPS, camera). The surge of mobile devices on the consumer side has allowed organzations like Text to Change to pioneer the field of interactive sms programs for a wide range of purposes.

With all these tools and methods available, it is very important to pick the right tool or channel for each collection effort. Text to Change understands this very well and they have been building the capacity to reach people in different ways. For the more complex surveys, they have a small call center in Kampala that can efficiently conduct personal interviews throughout the region.  
Over the past months we have worked with them on a new release of Airwolf, the tool used by the call center, an effort partly funded by SIDA. This post contains a brief overview of the tool and its key features.

## Process
The preparation of a survey is pretty straightforward. The TTC staff can upload the survey definition in the XLSForm format and add the phone numbers that need to be called. After assigning the call center agents to the survey, these can start the data collection effort.
