Next week, the whole team will be in Berlin for the [2014 Open Knowledge Festival](http://2014.okfestival.org/) and all the fringe events that surround it. [...]

{% include content_img.html path="notes/note-flipside-redesign-process.png" %}

On Tuesday, Olaf will give a brief presentation at CSVConf about [Airwolf](http://) and Openrosa in a call center setting. It focuses specifically on some of the data-related challenges we encountered during the build.

## Get in touch
We're looking forward to talk to a lot of like-minded people and get inspired by all the 'open' projects and tools from around the world. If you want to meet us, let us know by sending an email or tweet.
