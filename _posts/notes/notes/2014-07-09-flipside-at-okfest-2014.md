Next week, the whole team will be in Berlin for the [2014 Open Knowledge Festival](http://2014.okfestival.org/) and all the fringe events that surround it.

On Tuesday, July 15, Olaf will give a brief presentation at [CSVConf](http://csvconf.com) about [Airwolf](http://flipside.org/project/airwolf) and Openrosa in a call center setting. It focuses specifically on some of the data-related challenges and lessons we learned during the build.

## Let's meet
We're looking forward to talk to a lot of like-minded people and get inspired by all the 'open' projects and tools from around the world. If you want to meet us, let us know by [email](mailto:info@flipside.org) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/flipside_org).
