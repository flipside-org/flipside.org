Next Thursday we are hosting an Open Data Happy Hour, the first of a series of Open Data related events we're planning to organize in 2015. If you're in Lisbon and are interested in having a drink with us and talk Open Data, feel free to drop by. During the event, I'll be around to demo some experiments we've been doing with node and sensors.

This Happy Hour will be a special occassion for us, especially since we'll be joined by our friends from [Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org) who are co-hosting the event. [Ian Schuler](https://twitter.com/ianschuler) will be in Lisbon next week, so this is a great opportunity to talk with him and know more about the work they've been doing with [Open Data in elections](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2014/07/03/afgh-audits/), helping the [Mexican government publish Open Data](http://www.developmentseed.org/blog/2014/10/01/mexico-open-data-push/), or building better [satellite imagery tools](http://www.developmentseed.org/blog/2014/08/29/landsat-util/).
