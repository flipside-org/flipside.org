[Text to Change](http://www.texttochange.com/) is a global innovator implementing interactive and incentive based SMS programmes around the world.

We worked with TTC to develop MacGyver, a practical and flexible system that allows them to coordinate their growing portfolio of activities. Each employee has a personal dashboard providing an overview with the relevant projects and their milestones and leads.

More information about the system and a demo can be found at: [http://macgyver.texttochange.org](http://macgyver.texttochange.org)
