Red Suchitoto is a network for micro and small businesses in Suchitoto, El Salvador. Together with [Fundación Redes](http://redes.org/ "Fundación Redes") and [STRO](http://www.stro-ca.org "STRO Centroamérica") we developed a Management Information System that allows the local staff to coordinate the network and improve the services provided to the members.

The system is accesible through a web interface and, to decrease the paperwork for those working in the field, data can also be collected using basic Android mobile phones.
