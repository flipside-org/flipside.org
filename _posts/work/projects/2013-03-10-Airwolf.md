For [Text to Change](http://texttochange.org) and Research Africa we designed and developed Airwolf, an application based on Openrosa, the popular and open-source standard for data collection. Airwolf is, first and foremost, built to collect data in a call center context, tightly integrating the webforms with functionalities to manage respondents and their phone numbers. 

Out of the box, Airwolf supports two roles with different access levels: moderators and agents. The moderators have permissions that include access to detailed statistics about the progress of the surveys, while agents have a more limited set of permissions and are only allowed to collaborate on the surveys they are assigned to.  
During the build, we put a lot of effort in ensuring a good and simple user experience throughout the process: from the upload of the survey definition, to data entry and export of the results. Given Kampala's frequent internet outages, this includes making it - to a certain extent - off-line capable to ensure 
that the agents can continue the collection process, without having to fear for loss of data. 

For more information regarding Airwolf, please read [our blog post](/notes/data-collection-for-call-centers/) detailing some of the application's key aspects.
