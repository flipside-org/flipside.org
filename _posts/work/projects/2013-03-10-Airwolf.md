[Research Africa](http://www.researchafrica.com) is a market reseach agency that aims to give a voice to the consumers at the Bottom of the Pyramid. Faced with the
challenge of managing a big amount of (sensitive) data, Research Africa partnered with Flipside to develop a comprehensive solution.

Airwolf is a fully web-based application, allowing to manage the organisation's surveys and respondent panels and safely store the survey data in a consistent manner. On top of that, Airwolf provides analysis, visualization and reporting functionalities to turn the raw data into something meaningful.
