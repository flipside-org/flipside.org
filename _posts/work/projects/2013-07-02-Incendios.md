Every year, fires consume vast amounts of forest and agricultural land in Portugal. In the end of 2012, the [ICNF](http://www.icnf.pt) published detailed fire data for the period 2001 - 2011. Based on this dataset of over 360.000 occurrences, we built [incendios.pt](http://www.incendios.pt), a site to explore the data by topic and location.

Since every occurrence is geo-referenced, maps play an important role in the visualization of the data. Every administrative area in Portugal (district, municipality and parish) has its own page, showing the relevant statistics for the region.
