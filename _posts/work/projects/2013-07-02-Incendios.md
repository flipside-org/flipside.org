Every year, fires consume vast amounts of forest and agricultural land in Portugal. In the end of 2012, the [ICNF](http://www.icnf.pt) published fire data for the period 2001 - 2011, that, although detailed and well structured, is impossible to process and analyse for most people. In order to make this important dataset of over 360.000 occurrences more accessible for the general public, Flipside built [incendios.pt](http://www.incendios.pt), a site to explore the data by topic and location.

Since every occurrence is geo-referenced, maps play an important role in the visualization of the data. Every district, municipality and freguesia in Portugal has its own page, showing the relevant statistics that can also be downloaded in CSV format.

Flipside has been committed to keep the site up to date and publish new fire data released by ICNF.
