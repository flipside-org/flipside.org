For over 20 years, the [Multilateral Investment Fund](http://fomin.org) has been a driving force in improving livelihoods throughout Latin America and the Carribean. To celebrate this fact, the MIF created [http://20.fomin.org](http://20.fomin.org) to tell the stories behind their work and the impact created over the years.  

Our challenge was to create a website simple in structure, while doing justice to the history of the institution. The result is a static, but rich one-pager, that works well on different devices and screen sizes.
