Over the years, TTC Mobile has reached millions of people with their mobile solutions and through their projects they manage a big amount of personal information. Aware of the need to manage this data responsibly, TTC Mobile is working with us to develop a structured approach to manage the data of its respondents.

Together with the organization's technical team, we designed an API that focuses on tracking two things of the respondents: their provenance; and their participation in the projects. The different data collection tools connect straight to the API to fetch respondents and register any interaction, thus limiting the need for TTC staff to pass around files with personal information or do manual imports.
