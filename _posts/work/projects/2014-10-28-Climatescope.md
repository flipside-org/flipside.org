The [Climatescope](http://global-climatescope.org) is both a report and tool that provides investors, entrepreneurs and policy makers with information about the clean energy sector in emerging markets.  
Originally published by the [Multilateral Investment Fund](http://fomin.org) and [Bloomberg New Energy Finance](http://about.bnef.com), the Climatescope started in 2012 by examining 26 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. In collaboration with our friends from [Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org), we partnered with these organizations to build a completely new tool for the 2014 edition and expand its reach to 55 countries around the world.

Given the relatively static nature of the Climatescope's data and content and our experience building CMS-less tools, we went with a simple tech stack including Jekyll and Angular. The result is a static and highly performant site that doesn't compromise on the dynamic feel.
