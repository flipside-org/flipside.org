On Thursday October 17, we'll be hosting another Open Data Maker Night. These nights are focused on making stuff with Open Data. Everybody is welcome, you don't need to be a skilled developer, data scientist or designer to make things happen.

### What we'll be working on
One of the lessons we learned during the last event, is that we need concrete ideas for people to work on. For the next session we have gathered a couple of people that will serve as "initiative owners". The role of these people is to prepare the tasks and be able to kick-start the activities during the evening. The list below is not exhaustive and we invite you to bring your own ideas to the table.

- **Open Spending**  
During the last meetup, a start was made to gather data on "Ajustes Diretos" in order to add it to Open Spending. The data has since been gathered and will be uploaded soon. During the night, designers and developers can collaborate to analyse and visualise the data.
- **Marriages and divorces**  
Based on data from the [INE](http://www.ine.pt), people will work on a visualization about differences between same sex and opposite sex marriages and divorces.
- **Open Data Census**  
The Open Data Census tracks the status of government open data on the national level. A sprint has been planned for the month October to revise the current data in the census and improve its quality, in time for the [Open Government Partnership Summit](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/london-summit-2013). During the meetup we'll focus on improving the census for Portugal.
- **Visualizing diversity**  
Over the past years, a lot of attention was given to the exodus of Portuguese, but little to people coming in. During the night we'll take a look at the diversity of nationalities in Lisbon.

If you want to add anything to this list, please [drop us](mailto:olaf@flipside.org) a line.
