		About
	</h1>
	
	<p>Flipside is a web development agency based in Lisbon. The majority of our clients operate in the international development sector, from small NGOs to big multilateral institutions, and we usually work with them on the full project cycle. Besides web development, we also provide consultancy services.<br/>
	In all our projects, we strive to develop appropriate solutions. Solutions that solve the problem at hand and that suit the context of our clients. Typically we are involved in the full project cycle, from concept development to deployment.</p>
	
	<h3>Open Source</h3>
	<p>We believe that Open Source is a strong driver of innovation, that it increases the access to technology and can prevent a vendor lock-in. In our projects we adopt Open Source technology whenever we can and contribute back as much as possible with code, documentation, or by organizing and sponsoring community events.</p>
