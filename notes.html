  There is nothing to do in this file. The code related to the rendering of
  each individual note in the list is in the include note_list_element.
  Code related to the wrapper of that list is inside the layout notes_list.
  
  Note: The code for a list with and without filters applied is the same.
  The only difference is an active class in the filter's menu.
